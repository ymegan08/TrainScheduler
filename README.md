# TrainScheduler
Created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. Also added animated effects within the site.

Used:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) Javascript
4) jQuery
5) Firebase API
